# Python Basics
In this demo we will cover some basic information that will help you install and start programming in Python.

## What is Python
Python is a simple yet powerful programing language. It is an easy language to learn but still powerful due to the extensive pre-made code modules you can freely download (code modules are files with code in them.) 

Here are some facts to know:

-	Python is free to use, even for commercial products! 
- Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, and Mac OS X 
-	There are two main versions of Python 2.x and 3.x 
- Both version 2.x and 3.x can be installed on the same computer
-	Mac already has 2.x installed  
-	Python 2.x has been deprecated as of January 2020
-	Python 3.x is recommended for all new projects

## Installing Python
Python is easy to download and install.  A quick internet search will provide you with a download link and several installation videos based on your chosen OS. https.//www.google.com/search?q=How+to+install+python (external site). 

*Note:* If you install both, make sure to use the correct version when running your scripts. You can check  version you are running using the -V switch from the command terminal of your computer (Figure 1).
