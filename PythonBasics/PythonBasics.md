# Python Basics
In this demo we will cover some basic information that will help you install and start programming in Python.

## What is Python
Python is a simple yet powerful programing language. It is an easy language to learn but still powerful due to the extensive pre-made code modules you can freely download (code modules are files with code in them.) 

Python is free to use, even for commercial products! 

Here are some facts you need to know:
•	Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, and Mac OS X 
•	There are two main versions of Python 2.x and 3.x 
•	Both version 2.x and 3.x can be installed on the same computer
•	Mac already has 2.x installed  
•	Python 2.x has been deprecated as of January 2020
•	Python 3.x is recommended for all new projects

## Installing Python
Python is easy to download and install.  A quick internet search will provide you with a download link and several installation videos based on your chosen OS. https.//www.google.com/search?q=How+to+install+python (external site). 

*Note:* If you install both, make sure to use the correct version when running your scripts. You can check  version you are running using the -V switch from the command terminal of your computer (Figure 1).
