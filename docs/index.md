In this demo we will cover the basic information on installing, running, and programming with Python. By the end of this demonstration you will know how Python can be installed and used on your Mac or Windows computer.

## What is Python
Python is a simple yet powerful programing language. It is an easy language to learn but still powerful due to the extensive pre-made code modules you can freely download (code modules are files with code in them.) 

Here are some facts to know:

-	Python is free to use, even for commercial products! 
- Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, and Mac OS X 
-	There are two main versions of Python 2.x and 3.x 
- Both version 2.x and 3.x can be installed on the same computer
-	Mac already has 2.x installed  
-	Python 2.x has been deprecated as of January 2020
-	Python 3.x is recommended for all new projects

## Installing Python
Python is easy to download and install.  A quick internet search will provide you with a download link and several installation videos based on your chosen OS. https.//www.google.com/search?q=How+to+install+python (external site). This page is context-sensitive and should recognize your OS then provide the appropriate download option.


## Installing Python
To install Python, you must first download the installation program from Python.org website. Figure 2, shows an example of what the site's download page looks like. Clicking the "Download Python" button should start downloading the software automatically.

Afterward, you run the .exe or .dmg file to start the installation, depending on your operating system. 
For a Windows installation, I recommend you check the checkbox to include Python's executable in the OS path, then click the custom option to choose an easy-to-access location like C.\Python\Python3.x for its installation folder (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Customizing the Python installation


The Mac installer has fewer options than the Windows version and more text to read, but selecting the default options is fine.

**_Important:_** Restarting your Mac may be required and is recommend after the installation.

## Running Python
Once you have installed Python, you can run it interactively using a Console/Terminal or by creating scripts with a text editor. Both options have their place, and I recommend you always test your programs using both. 

### The Console/Terminal Interface
To open a command console in Windows, use the Start button or Windows key + r keyboard combination to open the Run dialog, then type in the command "CMD" into "Open" the textbox. Clicking the Command Prompt App option opens a command prompt window. With the Command Prompt open, type Python.exe to begin an interactive session (Figure 5).

If you are using a Mac, it is almost the same, but now the Command Prompt is called a "Terminal" window. Open a Terminal window using Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app. You can access the Python's interactive mode by typing in the "Python3" command in the Terminal window (Figure 6).

## Demonstration
In this demonstration your instructor will walkthrough the process of installing and using Python on a Windows computer. Your are encourged to follow along if you would like.

This demo consists of the following steps:

1. Download the Python installer from Python.Org.
2. Run the installation program.
3. Open a command prompt and start Python in interactive mode.
4. Use the following common commands, one at a time, to show how the interactive mode works.

```python
first_name = input("Enter your first name")
last_name = input("Enter your last name")
print("You enter", first_name, last_name)

```
In this demonstration you saw how Python can be use with the interactive mode. In the next section, look at how to create a Python script.
